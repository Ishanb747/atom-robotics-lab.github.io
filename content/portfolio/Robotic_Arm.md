# ROBOTIC ARM

A.J.G.A.R project, which features a 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) robotic arm that can move in six directions.It is commonly used in industrial and manufacturing settings for tasks such as pick and place, assembly, and welding.

## ABOUT A.J.G.A.R

 A.J.G.A.R is designed to autonomously handle objects, utilizing computer vision technology for this purpose. It also supports remote operation via teleoperation.

The six degrees of freedom are typically achieved through the use of six stepper motors. Each stepper motor controls a single joint of the robot arm, and together they allow the arm to move in a wide range of motions. The stepper motors are controlled by a computer, which sends signals to the motors telling them how to move.

This project is divided mainly into three parts:

**SOFTWARE** : the programming of this project is done using inverse kinematics, gazebo and rviz simulation and perception. With the help of a kinect camera we precisely predicted its environment in 3D, which improved the interaction with objects and people.

**HARDWARE** : firstly a cad model was designed for optimized use case then all the components were manufactured and assembled.

**ELECTRONICS**: the electronics comprised of sensor interfacing and wiring placing
