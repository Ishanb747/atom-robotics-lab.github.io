### MR ROBOT GUI

Welcome to the vibrant world of MR-ROBOT-gui- a generalized web gui for controlling ros based robots, where ROS and JavaScript converge to create a seamless Web UI for taking charge of Mr. Robot.

## The ROBOT-gui

It stands as a testament to the fusion of cutting-edge technology, blending ROS and JavaScript to bring you a web interface that redefines the way you control and monitor ROS-based robots. Our web application is not just about remote control; it's about an immersive and dynamic interaction with your robot. Real-time control and monitoring are no longer a chore; they're an exhilarating experience. Navigate effortlessly through our thoughtfully crafted user interface.

Thanks to MR-ROBOT-gui, the power to interact with your robot is now at your fingertips, accessible through any web browser. Whether you're at home, in the office, or on the go, the connection remains seamless, and the control remains in your hands. Comprises of a power button, minimap which expands to full screen on double click, also allows to set a goal for the robot to move to a desired position, joystick control to feel the movement of robot at fingertips
