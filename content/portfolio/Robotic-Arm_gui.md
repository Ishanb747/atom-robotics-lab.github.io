 By leveraging a ROSBridge server, the application facilitates seamless communication with the robotic arm, allowing users to control its movements effortlessly. The interface supports various functionalities, ensuring precise and accurate operation, making it ideal for research, educational purposes, and advanced robotics projects. With this setup, users can experience enhanced interactivity and control, significantly improving the user experience and usability of the robotic arm.
