A.T.O.M stands for Advanced Techtronix Organization of MAIT. Here we are trying to build a Society | Community around making more Intelligent and Advanced robots by introducing technologies like ROS (Robot Operating System), CAD (Computer Aided Design), Embedded Systems/IOT, Software Engineering etc.

Many robotics societies all around never go beyond building line followers and wall followers. Though they are the basics and an integral part of robotics and we will also make them, we also want to go way beyond that and introduce you to industrial robotics through the idea of project based learning by making many amazing projects. From room cleaning roombas to self driving mobile UGVs to industrial robotic arms.

No one is perfect! We are not special either. There are many things that we want to learn from ya’ll as much as we can and in return try to give back as much as we can. That’s how we build a community.

Don’t have money to join? Doesn’t matter. We DO NOT take any money from anyone who wants to join! We don’t want to burden anyone by asking for money.
Don’t know about Hardware/Mechanical? Doesn’t matter. Robotics requires minds from all over engineering. We DON’T CARE about your marks, your age, your year, your branch. We care that you want to learn, teach, grow and make things.
All we need is a strong will power to get stuff done. That’s it
